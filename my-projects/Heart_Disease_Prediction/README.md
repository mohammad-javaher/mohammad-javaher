# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various health metrics.
## ðŸ§  Goal
To build and evaluate a machine learning model that can predict heart disease using clinical features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG, Max Heart Rate, etc.
- Target: Presence or absence of heart disease

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling & Evaluation)

## ðŸ“ˆ Models Trained
- logistic regression
- naive bayes
- SVM
- decision tree
- RandomForest
